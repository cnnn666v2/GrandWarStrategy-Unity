# Grand War Strategy - a Unity 6 game template

This project is a template for creating a game like Age of History 2, or Hearts of Iron IV. There is no guarantee it will be ever finished, or become as modular as I would like it to be. Some features are also straight up impossible for me to do, such as automatic placement of BoxColliders on a custom object's shape.

The project is in very early alpha stages, so many things are unoptimized and meassy.

## Features

- Province data - each province has it's own data, such as id or placed buildings
- Province neighbour's detection - each province automatically detects its neighbours
- Country system - different countries, holding data such as owned provinces or money
- Painting provinces - each province's material color is painted according to country's color, or the randomly generated color of a province (each province has unique color)
- Turn system - all actions, such as money income, are made each turn
- Governments - each country has government type, such as "Democracy", although this (and many other features) will be expanded on in the future
- Building construction - you are able to construct different buildings in a province

## Planned features

- Save/Load games - abilit to save and load current game session
- Easy modding - easily add new building types, governments, countries, etc. via json files
- Technology/Research - each country will be able to research new technologies, similiar to HoI4
- Turn based combat - this will be a mix of AoH2 and HoI4 combat systems,  province housing armies will be able to attack neigbouring foreign provinces, assuming both countries are at war
- Focus Trees - each country will be able to have its own focus trees, with each providing different kinds of bonuses
- Political parties - similiar to HoI4, each country will have a bunch of political parties, based on the current ruling party, country's ideology will depend on the party's ideology (Government)
- Different law types - each country will be able to have different economic, conscription, trade, education, etc. laws
- And many more, but first I'll be working on the very basics
